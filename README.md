# 10 Week Applied LLM course for beginners
Welcome to "Applied LLM"! I'm thrilled to have you here. Over the next 10 weeks, we're going on a journey to not just learn about Large Language Models, but to master the art of building practical, real-world applications with them. 

We'll start with the absolute basics‚Äîwhat an LLM even is‚Äîand quickly move into the hands-on, project-based work that will define this course. Forget dense theory and abstract concepts; our focus is on building, experimenting, and solving problems.

My goal is to equip you with the skills to confidently develop, evaluate, and deploy your own LLM applications, turning you from a beginner into a skilled practitioner. 

Let's get started.

## Note: This course needs basic uderstanding of Python.

### **Applied LLM Course Roadmap**

**Course Philosophy:**

* **Applied, not Theoretical:** The focus is on practical application. Theory is provided to understand the "why," but the majority of time is spent on the "how."
* **Simple is Key:** Complex concepts are broken down into simple, digestible pieces. Jargon is avoided unless it is clearly explained.
* **Practice, Practice, Practice:** Learning is an active process. The course includes hands-on exercises, coding challenges, and a final project to solidify understanding.
* **From Zero to Hero:** The curriculum starts with the absolute basics and progressively builds to advanced topics. No prior knowledge of LLMs is assumed.
