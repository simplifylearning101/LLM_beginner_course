## Brief summary of Week 2's content

**Week 2: From Concept to Code - Building with LLM APIs**

This week, we transitioned from the theoretical understanding of LLMs to hands-on, programmatic application. We started by diving deep into **core prompt engineering techniques in code**, learning how to use Python to provide clear instructions, inject dynamic context, and leverage few-shot examples for precise LLM control.

A major focus was on **extracting structured data**, where we mastered guiding LLMs to output information in machine-readable formats like JSON, a critical skill for integrating LLMs into larger data pipelines. We then explored **text transformation and summarization**, enabling us to programmatically condense, expand, and alter the tone and style of text to fit various needs.

Moving into more creative and interactive applications, we covered **content generation**, experimenting with LLMs as creative co-pilots for brainstorming and drafting diverse text, while understanding how parameters like `temperature` influence creativity. This led us to building **conversational agents and chatbots**, where we learned to manage conversation state, maintain context across multiple turns, and handle the inherent "memory" challenge of LLMs.

Finally, we tackled the practicalities of **handling real-world input and output**, reading from files and web pages, and writing LLM outputs back to the file system. We wrapped up by focusing on **error handling and robustness**, implementing strategies like API retries and output validation to ensure our LLM applications are reliable and resilient. We also touched upon **advanced prompting techniques like chaining LLM calls and basic agentic patterns**, empowering LLMs to perform multi-step reasoning, and even glimpsed the future with **multimodal LLMs**.

In essence, Week 2 equipped you with the foundational coding skills to build a wide array of functional, robust, and intelligent applications using LLM APIs.
