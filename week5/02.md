### Day 2: Audio Transcription & Summarization ðŸŽ§

Processing audio is another powerful capability that can open up new use cases for your applications. We will use OpenAI's **Whisper** model for fast and accurate **Speech-to-Text** transcription.

#### **Hands-on Session: Turning Speech into Text**

1.  **Preparation:**

      * You'll need a short audio file in a common format like `mp3`, `mp4`, `wav`, or `m4a`. You can record one yourself or find one online.

2.  **Code: Transcribing an Audio File**

      * The OpenAI API's audio transcription endpoint is incredibly simple to use. You just need to pass the file object directly.
      * Let's write a script to transcribe a short audio clip.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    import openai
    import os

    # Your OpenAI API key
    openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

    # Path to your local audio file
    audio_path = "path/to/your/audio.mp3"

    # Transcribe the audio file
    try:
        audio_file = open(audio_path, "rb")
        transcript = openai.audio.transcriptions.create(
            model="whisper-1",
            file=audio_file
        )
        print("Transcription:")
        print(transcript.text)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    ```

3.  **Code: Summarizing the Transcription**

      * Once you have the text transcription, you can easily pass it to a regular language model to get a summary.
      * Add this code snippet after the transcription step:

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    # Summarize the transcription
    summary_prompt = f"Summarize the following text in a single paragraph:\n\n{transcript.text}"

    try:
        summary_response = openai.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": summary_prompt}
            ],
            max_tokens=200
        )
        print("\nSummary:")
        print(summary_response.choices[0].message.content)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during summarization: {e}")
    ```

#### **Homework:**

  * Combine your agentic framework from Week 3 with the audio transcription. Create an agent that can be fed a transcribed audio file and then be asked questions about its content. For example, "What were the key action items from this meeting?"
