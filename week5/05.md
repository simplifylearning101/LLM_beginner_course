Let's make Day 5 a unique and more complex experience focused on the dynamic interaction of speech.

### Day 5: Real-Time Text-to-Speech & Conversational Agents üó£Ô∏è

Today, we'll build a bidirectional voice interface. We'll start with the basics of converting text to spoken words and then combine it with our speech-to-text knowledge to create a full, conversational AI.

#### **Hands-on Session 1: Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

First, let's enable our AI to "speak." We will use OpenAI's Text-to-Speech API to convert a simple text string into an audio file.

1.  **Preparation:** Make sure the `openai` library is installed.

2.  **Code: Generating an Audio File:** The API is straightforward. You provide the text, choose a voice, and the model generates an audio file.

    ```python
    import openai
    import os

    client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

    text_to_speak = "Hello! I am a helpful AI assistant. How can I help you today?"
    speech_file_path = "greeting.mp3"

    try:
        response = client.audio.speech.create(
            model="tts-1",
            voice="alloy",  # Other options: 'echo', 'fable', 'onyx', 'nova', 'shimmer'
            input=text_to_speak
        )

        with open(speech_file_path, "wb") as f:
            f.write(response.content)
            
        print(f"Audio file saved to {speech_file_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    ```

#### **Hands-on Session 2: The Conversational Loop**

This is the main project for the day. We'll build a script that:

1.  Listens for the user's speech (Speech-to-Text).
2.  Sends the transcribed text to a language model (LLM).
3.  Receives the text response from the LLM.
4.  Converts the text response into speech (Text-to-Speech).
5.  Plays the audio back to the user.

<!-- end list -->

  * **Prerequisites:** You'll need a working microphone and the `pyaudio` and `wave` libraries. `pyaudio` handles audio I/O.

    ```bash
    pip install pyaudio SpeechRecognition
    ```

  * **Code: Two-Way Voice Chatbot:**

    ```python
    import openai
    import os
    import pyaudio
    import wave
    import speech_recognition as sr

    # Initialize OpenAI and SpeechRecognition
    client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

    def record_audio(duration=5, filename="input.wav"):
        CHUNK = 1024
        FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16
        CHANNELS = 1
        RATE = 44100
        
        audio = pyaudio.PyAudio()
        stream = audio.open(format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS, rate=RATE, input=True, frames_per_buffer=CHUNK)
        print("Listening...")
        
        frames = []
        for _ in range(0, int(RATE / CHUNK * duration)):
            data = stream.read(CHUNK)
            frames.append(data)
            
        print("Done listening.")
        stream.stop_stream()
        stream.close()
        audio.terminate()
        
        with wave.open(filename, 'wb') as wf:
            wf.setnchannels(CHANNELS)
            wf.setsampwidth(audio.get_sample_size(FORMAT))
            wf.setframerate(RATE)
            wf.writeframes(b''.join(frames))
        return filename

    def transcribe_audio(audio_file):
        with open(audio_file, "rb") as audio_f:
            transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(model="whisper-1", file=audio_f)
        return transcript.text

    def synthesize_speech(text, filename="response.mp3"):
        response = client.audio.speech.create(model="tts-1", voice="alloy", input=text)
        with open(filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write(response.content)
        return filename

    def play_audio(filename):
        os.system(f"afplay {filename}") # For macOS. For Windows, use `start {filename}`

    def get_llm_response(prompt):
        llm_response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            max_tokens=150
        )
        return llm_response.choices[0].message.content

    # Main conversational loop
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print("Starting voice chatbot. Say something!")
        
        while True:
            # 1. Record user audio
            input_audio_file = record_audio(duration=5)
            
            # 2. Transcribe
            user_text = transcribe_audio(input_audio_file)
            print(f"User: {user_text}")
            
            if user_text.lower().strip() in ["stop", "exit", "quit"]:
                print("Goodbye!")
                break
            
            # 3. Get LLM response
            llm_text = get_llm_response(user_text)
            print(f"AI: {llm_text}")
            
            # 4. Synthesize and play response
            response_audio_file = synthesize_speech(llm_text)
            play_audio(response_audio_file)
    ```

#### **Homework:**

  * Enhance the `transcribe_audio` function to include timestamps for each word. Refer to the OpenAI documentation for the `response_format` parameter.
  * Add more complexity to the loop by storing the conversation history and including it in the `get_llm_response` call to enable a multi-turn conversation.

### Day 6: Advanced & Future Trends in Multimodality üöÄ

Today, we'll wrap up the week by looking at the cutting edge of multimodal AI. While we've focused on images, audio, and video, the field is rapidly expanding to include other data types and more advanced techniques.

#### **Concepts to Ponder**

  * **Multimodal RAG:** Just as we used text-based RAG to augment our models' knowledge, we can apply the same principle to other modalities. Imagine a database of images, audio files, or videos. We could query it based on a user's text prompt, find the most relevant media, and then provide that to the LLM as context. This is known as **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (Multimodal RAG).
  * **Other Modalities:** Research is ongoing to integrate other data types, such as 3D models, scientific charts and graphs, and even medical imaging like X-rays and MRIs. These specialized models are trained to reason about complex data and can revolutionize fields like healthcare and engineering.
  * **Agentic Frameworks:** The multimodal agent you built in Day 4 is a great starting point. In the future, these agents will likely have a more sophisticated "reasoning loop" that can choose the best modality to answer a question or perform a task. For example, if a user asks for a recipe, the agent might decide to generate an instructional video in addition to providing a text response.

#### **Final Project: The Ultimate Multimodal Assistant**

To solidify your learning, let's build the ultimate project for the week.

1.  **Refine Your Agent:** Use the logic from your Day 4 homework to create a single function that can take any combination of a `text_prompt`, an `image_path`, and an `audio_path`.
2.  **Build a CLI Interface:** Create a command-line interface (CLI) that prompts the user to either enter a text query, provide an image path, or provide an audio path.
3.  **Process and Respond:** Depending on the user's input, call your ultimate multimodal function.
4.  **Display:** Print the final response from the LLM, showing the power of your agent to handle any combination of modalities the user throws at it.
