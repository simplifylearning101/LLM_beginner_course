### **Week 1: Part 7 - From Prompt to Application Idea: Use Cases & Design Thinking**

#### **Theory: Envisioning LLMs in Real-World Scenarios**
To start thinking beyond individual prompts and consider how LLM capabilities can be combined to solve real-world problems, laying the groundwork for application development.

**Common Application Patterns:**

* **Content Generation:** Tools that write marketing copy, social media posts, blog drafts, or even code.
* **Customer Support:** Chatbots that answer FAQs, assist users, or route complex queries to human agents.
* **Information Retrieval/Q\&A:** Systems that can answer questions based on a specific set of documents (like a company's internal knowledge base).
* **Text Transformation:** Tools that summarize documents, translate languages, rephrase text, or extract structured data.
* **Education & Learning:** Personalized tutors, language learning companions, or tools to explain complex topics.

**Identifying Opportunities:**

* Look for tasks that are:
    * **Text-heavy:** Lots of reading, writing, or summarizing.
    * **Repetitive:** Tasks that involve doing the same thing over and over with text.
    * **Creative but Time-Consuming:** Brainstorming, drafting, generating ideas.
* LLMs are excellent for these "assistive" roles, acting as a co-pilot.

**Design Thinking for LLMs (Simplified):**

* **Empathize:** Understand the user and their problem.
* **Define:** Clearly state the problem you want to solve.
* **Ideate:** Brainstorm how an LLM could be part of the solution.
* **Prototype:** Start with simple prompts to test your ideas (what we're doing now\!).
* **Test:** Evaluate if your LLM solution actually helps.

#### Brainstorming & Prompting for Application Ideas**
To brainstorm real-world problems and prototype initial LLM solutions using prompts, focusing on how a sequence of prompts could mimic an application's flow.

**Task 1: Problem Identification & LLM Role:**
Identify a small, relatable problem and define how an LLM could help.

**Think:**
What's a repetitive text-based task you dislike? (e.g., writing meeting summaries, drafting social media posts, generating gift ideas). How could an LLM assist with this?

**Your First Prompt (to the LLM):**
    ```
    You are a helpful assistant. I'm trying to think of how LLMs could solve small, everyday problems. Can you brainstorm 3 unique ideas for LLM applications that would help someone organize their personal life?
    ```
See the ideas the LLM generates. This helps expand your own thinking.

**Task 2: Prototyping a "Meeting Summary" Application:**
Simulate a simple application flow for generating meeting summaries using a series of prompts.

**Scenario:** Imagine you have raw meeting notes and want a concise summary.

**Prompt 1 (Input Meeting Notes):**
  ```
  Here are raw notes from a team meeting. My goal is to get a professional summary with action items.

  Meeting Notes:
  - Discussed Q3 sales figures. John reported numbers were down 10% vs. forecast.
  - Mary suggested new marketing campaign for product X. Needs budget approval.
  - David brought up server stability issues, high CPU usage. Needs investigation. Action: David to research and report next week.
  - Next meeting scheduled for Friday at 2 PM to review campaign proposal.
  ```

**Prompt 2 (Generate Summary - in the *same* conversation):**
  ```
  Please summarize these notes into a concise paragraph, highlighting the key discussion points.
  ```

**Prompt 3 (Extract Action Items - in the *same* conversation):**
  ```
  Now, extract any specific action items from those notes and list them with who is responsible.
  ```
Did the LLM correctly summarize and extract action items? You've just simulated a basic meeting summary app flow.

**Task 3: Prototyping a "Content Idea Generator":**
Simulate an app that helps with creative content generation.

**Scenario:** You need ideas for a blog post.

**Prompt 1 (Initial Topic):**
  ```
  I'm looking for blog post ideas. My target audience is small business owners, and the topic is "social media marketing."
  ```
**Prompt 2 (Brainstorm Headings - in the *same* conversation):**
  ```
  Based on that, brainstorm 5 engaging blog post titles or headlines for articles about social media marketing for small business owners.
  ```
**Prompt 3 (Expand on an Idea - in the *same* conversation):**
  ```
  Pick the third title from your list and outline three key points or sections that article should cover.
  ```
How well did the LLM flow from general brainstorming to specific outline points? This shows its utility in creative workflows.

**Task 4: From Problem to Prototype - Your Turn:**
Take *one* of the personal life organization ideas from Task 1 (or your own idea) and prototype its initial interaction with 2-3 prompts.

**Your Idea:** (e.g., "LLM to suggest dinner recipes based on ingredients I have.")

**Your Prompts (to the LLM):** (e.g., "I have broccoli, and rice. Suggest 3 dinner recipes." then "For the first recipe, list the steps.")

Did the LLM meet your initial expectation for solving that problem?
