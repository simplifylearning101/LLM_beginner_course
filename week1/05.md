### **Week 1: Part 5 - Input/Output Patterns and Basic Data Handling**

#### Understanding Input and Shaping Output**
To understand that the LLM processes different types of input data and that we can effectively shape its output through specific instructions.

**LLMs and Different Input Types:**
LLMs are primarily text-based, but "text" can come in many forms:
  * **Plain Text:** The most common (sentences, paragraphs, articles).
  * **Structured Text:** Text that has a recognizable format (e.g., lists, tables, JSON-like structures within text).
  * **Code:** LLMs can process and generate programming code.
  * **Conversations:** A sequence of turns between a user and an LLM.

The LLM doesn't *see* images or hear audio directly, but it can process *text descriptions* of these. Then how modern LLMs like Grok, ChatGPT can handle image, voice etc? We will discuss this later. 

**Guiding Output Formats:**

We've seen how specific constraints help. Now, we'll formalize common output patterns:
- **Lists:** Numbered or bulleted.
- **Tables:** Simple tabular data.
- **Summaries:** Concise versions of longer text.
- **Extractions:** Pulling out specific pieces of information.
- **Transformations:** Changing text from one style/format to another.

**The Importance of "Delimiter" (Simple Concept):**

Sometimes, you need to provide a block of text to the LLM and tell it "this is the text to work on." To do this, we use **delimiters** â€“ special characters or phrases that clearly mark the beginning and end of a specific section of text.

**Example:** `"""Your text goes here"""` or `---BEGIN TEXT--- Your text ---END TEXT---`. These act like brackets in code, telling the LLM exactly where the relevant data starts and ends.

### Working with Structured Input and Output**
To practice providing different types of input and explicitly requesting structured or transformed output from the LLM.

**Task 1: Extracting Information from Plain Text:**
Practice pulling out specific facts from an unstructured paragraph.

**Prompt:**
```
Extract the following information from the text provided below:
1. Event Name
2. Date
3. Time
4. Location

Text:
"Our annual 'Community Cleanup Day' will be held on Saturday, October 26th, 2024, starting promptly at 9:00 AM. We will meet at the Central Park Gazebo before splitting into teams to tackle various areas of the park."
```
Did the LLM accurately extract each piece of information and present it in a clear format? This shows its ability to parse and structure information.

**Task 2: Text Transformation:**
Transform a piece of text into a different style or purpose.

**Prompt:**
```
Rewrite the following short paragraph as a marketing tweet (max 280 characters) for a new brand of eco-friendly cleaning products. Include relevant hashtags and emojis.

Paragraph:
"Our new line of cleaning products is designed with the planet in mind. Made from all-natural ingredients, they are powerful yet safe for your home and the environment. Join us in making a difference."
```
Did it condense the text effectively? Are hashtags and emojis used appropriately? Is it within the character limit? This highlights the LLM's capacity for creative text adaptation.

**Task 3: Using Delimiters for Clarity (15 minutes):**
Understand how delimiters help the LLM focus on a specific section of text.

**Prompt:**
```
The following text contains a product description. Your task is to extract only the key features and present them as a bulleted list.

---START DESCRIPTION---
Introducing the "Eco-Smart Water Bottle" - crafted from recycled aluminum, this bottle keeps your drinks cold for 24 hours and hot for 12. It features a leak-proof cap, a wide mouth for easy cleaning, and a comfortable ergonomic grip. Available in vibrant colors. Perfect for adventurers and daily commuters alike.
---END DESCRIPTION---
```
Did the LLM correctly identify and list only the features, ignoring other descriptive text like "Introducing" or "Perfect for"? The delimiters should help it accurately identify the target text.

**Task 4: Generating Structured Data:**

Instruct the LLM to generate content in a specific, structured format.
* **Prompt:**
```
Generate a simple table (using markdown table format) listing three common programming languages, their primary use cases, and their creator.
```
Does it produce a clear, readable table with columns and rows? This shows the LLM's ability to create structured data from scratch. (We'll learn about Markdown tables explicitly later if needed, but for now, just seeing the LLM generate one is the point).

### **Homework for Part 5**

**Exercise 1: Resume Keywords:**
- Imagine you have a short job description (e.g., for a "Junior Data Analyst"). Create a *brief* job description (3-4 sentences).
- Provide this description to an LLM, using delimiters (e.g., `###JOB DESCRIPTION###`).
- Prompt the LLM to "Extract 5 key skills/keywords that a candidate's resume should ideally contain to match this job description. Present them as a numbered list."
- Submit your job description, prompt, and the LLM's response.

**Exercise 2: Recipe Transformation:**
- Find a simple recipe online (e.g., for scrambled eggs or a basic sandwich).
- Prompt the LLM to "Rewrite this recipe as a set of easy-to-follow instructions for a child, using simple words and numbered steps. Do NOT include any measurements, just the steps."
- Submit the original recipe, your prompt, and the LLM's rewritten instructions.

**Exercise 3: The Pros and Cons Table:**
- Choose a common debate (e.g., "remote work vs. office work," "buying vs. renting a home").
- Prompt the LLM to "Generate a two-column table summarizing the top 3 pros and top 3 cons of [your chosen debate topic]."
- Submit your prompt and the LLM's generated table.
