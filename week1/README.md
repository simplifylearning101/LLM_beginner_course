### **Week 1: The Foundations of LLMs and Your First Interaction**

#### **Theme:** Demystifying LLMs, understanding their core function, and getting your hands on a language model for the very first time. No coding, just pure interaction and conceptual understanding.

#### **Topics Covered:**

1.  **What is an LLM? (The Simple Explanation):** We'll break down the jargon. Think of an LLM as a very advanced, incredibly powerful "text predictor." We won't get into the complex math or deep neural network architectures right away. The core concept is that it's a model trained on a massive amount of text to understand patterns, grammar, and context, allowing it to generate human-like text.
2.  **A Brief History (The Key Milestones):** We'll briefly touch on the evolution from older models to the modern Transformer architecture. The goal is to provide context and appreciation for how far we've come, not to get bogged down in technical details. We'll mention key models like GPT, BERT, and LLaMA, and what made them significant.
3.  **Core Capabilities and Common Use Cases:** We'll explore what LLMs are good at, such as:
      * **Text Generation:** Writing emails, stories, code, etc.
      * **Summarization:** Condensing long articles.
      * **Question Answering:** Providing information in a conversational manner.
      * **Translation:** Translating text between languages.
4.  **Hands-on Interaction with a Public LLM:** We'll use a widely available LLM interface (like the free version of ChatGPT or Google Gemini) to perform a series of guided tasks. This session is all about direct experience.

#### **Hands-on Session: Exploring the LLM Playground**

  * **Goal:** To directly experience the capabilities and limitations of an LLM.
  * **Tasks:**
    1.  **Warm-up:** Ask the LLM to introduce itself and explain what it does in a simple sentence.
    2.  **Creative Generation:** Ask it to write a short story about a brave mouse and a friendly dragon. Observe how it handles the narrative.
    3.  **Information Retrieval:** Ask it "What is the capital of France?" and then "How many people live there?" Pay attention to how it handles follow-up questions.
    4.  **Role-play:** Instruct it to act as a "movie critic" and ask it to review a recent film.
    5.  **Summarization:** Paste a short paragraph from a news article and ask it to summarize the key points in a single sentence.
    6.  **Deliberate Failure:** Try to make it fail or give a confusing answer. Ask it a vague or nonsensical question like "What is the color of the number 7?" or "Sing me a song about a flying dog." This helps us understand its boundaries.

#### **Simple Program with Comments (No Prerequisite Assumed)**

For this week, our "program" is not a Python script but a structured set of instructions to interact with an LLM. We'll call this our "Prompting Protocol." The comments are the instructions and what to observe.

```
# Week 1: Your First "Program" - The Prompting Protocol

# STEP 1: OPEN A PUBLIC LLM INTERFACE
# Open a new chat session on a platform like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Claude.
# We will use this interface as our "terminal" for this week.

# STEP 2: YOUR FIRST PROMPT
# This is our first line of code. It's a simple instruction.
# PROMPT:
# "Hello! Can you please tell me about yourself and what you are?"

# COMMENTARY:
# Observe the response. Does it sound like a person? Does it explain itself clearly?
# Notice how the LLM responds in a conversational manner.

# STEP 3: ASKING FOR CREATIVITY
# We are now testing the LLM's ability to generate new, creative content.
# PROMPT:
# "Write a short, 100-word story about a robot who wants to become a chef. Make it lighthearted and fun."

# COMMENTARY:
# Read the story. Does it have a logical flow? Is the tone correct?
# Pay attention to details like character names and plot points the LLM creates on its own.

# STEP 4: INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND CONTEXT
# We will now test the LLM's ability to answer questions from its internal knowledge.
# PROMPT 1:
# "What is the capital of Japan?"
# PROMPT 2 (in the same conversation, immediately after):
# "What is a popular food item from that city?"

# COMMENTARY:
# Did the LLM correctly answer the first question?
# More importantly, did it remember that "that city" refers to Tokyo in the second question?
# This shows how an LLM maintains a conversation's context.

# STEP 5: PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES (ERROR HANDLING)
# Let's see what happens when we give it a difficult or nonsensical task.
# PROMPT:
# "Please write a technical manual for a time travel device that runs on bananas."

# COMMENTARY:
# Observe the LLM's response. Does it say it can't? Does it try to make something up?
# This reveals the LLM's limitations and its ability to handle requests that fall outside its training data.

# END OF PROTOCOL
# You have just completed your first hands-on session with an LLM!
# By observing the outputs of these simple prompts, you have learned more than just theory.

#### **Homework Assignments:**

  * **Task 1: The Persona Challenge:**
      * Pick a historical figure (e.g., Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Leonardo da Vinci) or a fictional character (e.g., Sherlock Holmes, Hermione Granger, Yoda).
      * In a new chat, instruct the LLM to "act as" that character.
      * Ask the character three questions relevant to their life or expertise.
      * **Goal:** Observe how well the LLM mimics the character's style, vocabulary, and tone.
  * **Task 2: The "Why" behind the "What":**
      * From your interaction today, pick one response that surprised you or impressed you the most.
      * Write a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) explaining *why* you think the LLM was able to give that response. What did it do well? (For example, "It understood the nuance of the prompt," or "It generated a creative story with a clear plot.")
  * **Task 3: The Creative Prompt:**
      * Your final task is to design a unique prompt of your own.
      * It must be more than a simple question. It should involve multiple instructions or constraints.
      * Example: "Write a short poem about a rainy day, but use only words that have a 't' or an 'e' in them."
      * Submit your prompt and the LLM's response. We'll review some of the most creative ones next week\!

This week sets a strong, practical foundation without overwhelming students with code. The focus is on building intuition and confidence. The homework ensures they continue to experiment on their own. Next week, we'll introduce our first actual code and start to build on these fundamentals.
