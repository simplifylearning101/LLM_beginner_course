### **Week 1: The Foundations of LLMs and Your First Interaction**

#### **Theme:** Demystifying LLMs, understanding their core function, and getting your hands on a language model for the very first time. No coding, just pure interaction and conceptual understanding.

This week sets a strong, practical foundation without overwhelming students with code. The focus is on building intuition and confidence. The homework ensures they continue to experiment on their own. Next week, we'll introduce our first actual code and start to build on these fundamentals.
