Excellent\! We've reached the final hour of Week 1. This hour will be a crucial consolidation and preparation session. We'll review the key takeaways, address any lingering questions, and most importantly, prepare you for the coding and prompt engineering journey that begins next week. This is our moment to ensure everyone is confident and ready.

### **Week 1: Hour 10 - Week 1 Wrap-up, Q&A, and Preparing for Code**

#### **30% Theory: Consolidating Knowledge & Looking Ahead**

  * **Objective:** To review the core concepts covered in Week 1, reinforce key learnings, and explicitly outline the next steps into Python-based LLM interaction.

  * **Key Takeaways from Week 1:**

      * **LLMs are Text Predictors:** At their core, they predict the next most likely word based on vast training data. They don't "understand" or "think" like humans.
      * **Prompts are Your Instructions:** Your input is the primary way you "program" an LLM. Clarity, context, and constraints are paramount.
      * **Iterative Prompting is Key:** You rarely get the perfect answer on the first try. Refining your prompts is a fundamental skill.
      * **LLMs Have Limitations:** Be aware of "hallucinations," knowledge cutoffs, biases, and struggles with complex reasoning/math.
      * **Conversations Have "Memory":** But it's often an illusion; the history is usually re-sent with each turn.
      * **Control is Possible:** Parameters like "temperature" (and soon, more advanced techniques) allow you to influence output style.
      * **Think Beyond the Chat:** Start seeing LLMs as components within larger applications, considering user experience and error handling from the start.

  * **What's Coming Next: Your First Code\!**

      * Starting in Week 2, we will begin writing Python code to interact with LLMs programmatically. This means we'll move from typing into a web interface to writing scripts that send prompts and receive responses directly.
      * **Why Python?** It's the most common language for AI and machine learning due to its simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries.
      * **What we'll cover:**
          * Setting up your development environment (if you haven't already).
          * Using LLM APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to send and receive text.
          * Basic program structure for interacting with LLMs.

  * **Importance of Practice:** The hands-on nature of this course means consistent practice with both prompting and coding will be your biggest asset. Don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes â€“ that's how you learn\!

#### **70% Hands-on Session: Open Q&A and Final Interactive Challenge**

  * **Objective:** To address any questions or uncertainties you have from Week 1 and to reinforce the week's learnings with a final, comprehensive prompting challenge.

  * **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

    1.  **Preparation (10 minutes):**

          * Have your public LLM interface open.
          * Take a few minutes to review your notes, your homework from previous hours, and jot down any questions you have about LLMs, prompting, or what's coming next. No question is too basic\!

    2.  **Open Q&A Discussion (30 minutes):**

          * This is your time to ask anything. We'll discuss:
              * Any points of confusion about LLM concepts.
              * Challenges you faced with homework exercises or hands-on tasks.
              * General questions about the future of LLMs or specific applications.
              * We'll collectively answer questions, providing clarification and examples as needed.

    3.  **Final Challenge: The "Comprehensive Prompt" (25 minutes):**

          * **Goal:** To combine all the lessons from Week 1 into a single, complex prompt that tests your ability to provide clear instructions, context, constraints, and anticipate output.
          * **Scenario:** You're building a simple content creation assistant.
          * **Your Task:** In a *new* chat, construct a single prompt that accomplishes ALL of the following:
              * **Persona:** Act as a creative marketing strategist.
              * **Task:** Generate a short (max 4 sentences) social media post.
              * **Topic:** Promote a fictional new product: "Solar-Powered Backpack" (it charges devices while you walk).
              * **Tone:** Energetic and exciting.
              * **Constraints:** Must include 2 relevant hashtags, 1 emoji, and a call to action.
              * **Self-Reflection:** After generating the post, ask the LLM (in the *same prompt, or as a follow-up immediately*) to "Critique your own post: did you meet all the requirements? If not, state which one was missed."
          * **Observe:** How well did the LLM handle all the instructions in a single prompt? Did its self-critique accurately identify any misses? This is a great test of your prompting skills and the LLM's adherence.

    4.  **Discussion of Final Challenge (5 minutes):**

          * We'll briefly share some of the outputs from the final challenge. What worked well? What was difficult? This allows for peer learning and reinforces the iterative process.

  * **Conclusion of Hands-on Session:**

      * This final hour brought everything together, clarifying doubts and reinforcing the key skills you've developed. You've now gained a strong conceptual and experiential understanding of LLMs, and you're well-prepared for the exciting journey of coding with them.

### **Homework for Hour 10 (Preparation for Week 2)**

  * **Exercise 1: Environment Setup (Critical for Week 2):**
      * **Install Python:** If you don't have Python installed, download and install the latest stable version (e.g., Python 3.9+) from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux). Ensure you check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation on Windows.
      * **Install a Code Editor:** Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). It's a fantastic, free code editor that we'll use extensively.
      * **Verify Installation:**
          * Open your computer's terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
          * Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see your Python version.
          * Type `pip --version` and press Enter. You should see your pip (package installer) version.
      * **Goal:** Have Python and VS Code ready to go. *If you encounter any issues, don't worry! We'll dedicate time at the start of Week 2 to troubleshoot, but attempting it now will save time.*

  * **Exercise 2: Reflective Journal (Optional but Recommended):**
      * Write a short journal entry (1-2 paragraphs) about your biggest "aha!" moment or the most surprising thing you learned about LLMs this week. What changed in your understanding?
  * **Exercise 3: Last Prompting Practice:**
      * Pick one task you frequently do (e.g., writing a social media post, summarizing an email, planning an activity).
      * Create the *best possible single prompt* you can devise, incorporating all the principles of clarity, context, and constraints from this week, to automate or assist with that task using an LLM.
      * Keep this prompt handy; you might use it as inspiration for future coding exercises\!
