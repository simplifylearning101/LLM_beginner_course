Perfect. We're nearing the end of Week 1, and you've built a strong foundation. For **Week 1: Hour 9**, we'll focus on practical application design considerations that are crucial before we start writing code. This includes thinking about potential failure points, how to handle them, and the importance of user experience when integrating LLMs.

### **Week 1: Hour 9 - Preparing for Reality: Handling Failure & User Experience**

#### **30% Theory: Beyond the Perfect Prompt - Real-World Challenges**

  * **Objective:** To introduce the concept that LLM applications in the real world need to account for imperfect outputs, user error, and overall user experience.

  * **Anticipating LLM "Failures":**

      * We've learned that LLMs can hallucinate, make mathematical errors, miss instructions, or be biased. In a real application, these aren't just observations; they're potential problems that can break your app or frustrate your users.
      * **Robustness:** How well does your application handle unexpected or incorrect LLM outputs?
      * **Graceful Degradation:** What happens if the LLM output isn't perfect? Can your app still function or provide a reasonable fallback?

  * **Strategies for Handling Imperfect Outputs (Pre-coding):**

      * **Clear Instructions:** The first defense is always a well-crafted prompt.
      * **Validation Prompting:** Asking the LLM to *check its own work* or confirm facts. (e.g., "Summarize this, then tell me if any key dates are missing.")
      * **Output Structure Enforcement:** Demanding specific JSON or XML formats (even if just text-based for now) can make parsing easier for your app, and if the format is wrong, your app knows there's an issue.
      * **User Feedback Loops:** Providing an easy way for users to report bad outputs.
      * **Human Oversight (Human-in-the-Loop):** For critical applications, always have a human review the LLM's output before it's used.

  * **The User Experience (UX) with LLMs:**

      * How users interact with your LLM-powered app is vital.
      * **Transparency:** Users should know they are interacting with an AI.
      * **Setting Expectations:** Don't promise perfection. Explain what the LLM can and cannot do.
      * **Feedback Mechanisms:** Allow users to easily give feedback on outputs ("Was this helpful?").
      * **Clear Controls:** Provide ways for users to refine requests, change parameters (like "tone"), or start over.
      * **Speed:** LLM responses can take time. How do you handle loading states or latency?

#### **70% Hands-on Session: Stress-Testing & User-Centric Prompting**

  * **Objective:** To intentionally challenge LLMs to produce imperfect outputs and then design prompts to mitigate these issues, along with considering the user's perspective.

  * **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

    1.  **Preparation (5 minutes):**

          * Ensure your public LLM interface (ChatGPT or Google Gemini) is open.
          * Start a *new* chat session for each task.

    2.  **Task 1: Provoking a "Hallucination" & Self-Correction (15 minutes):**

          * **Goal:** Intentionally get a wrong answer and then prompt the LLM to self-correct.
          * **Prompt 1 (Designed to mislead, or for obscure info):**
            ```
            Who invented the concept of "fuzzy logic" and when was it first described in a widely recognized academic paper?
            ```
            *Note: The correct answer is Lotfi A. Zadeh in 1965. Observe if the LLM gets it wrong or struggles.*
          * **Observe:** Did it get the full answer right? If not (e.g., wrong name, wrong year, or vague date), proceed to Prompt 2.
          * **Prompt 2 (Self-Correction - in the *same* conversation):**
            ```
            Please double-check your previous answer. According to widely accepted academic sources, who invented fuzzy logic and in what year? Confirm your answer.
            ```
          * **Observe:** Did the LLM self-correct or provide a more accurate response after being prompted to check? This is a form of "validation prompting."

    3.  **Task 2: Handling Ambiguous User Input (15 minutes):**

          * **Goal:** Simulate a common user experience problem: vague input. Then, prompt the LLM to ask for clarification.
          * **Simulated User Input (you type this):**
            ```
            I need help planning my trip.
            ```
          * **Your "Application's" Response Prompt (what your app would send to the LLM):**
            ```
            The user wants help planning a trip. Their request is too vague. Your role is to act as a helpful AI travel agent. Ask the user follow-up questions to gather necessary details for trip planning (e.g., destination, dates, budget, interests). Ask exactly 3 clarifying questions.
            ```
          * **Observe:** Does the LLM ask pertinent, clarifying questions? This is a critical UX element: guiding the user rather than giving a generic, unhelpful first response.

    4.  **Task 3: Enforcing Strict Output Format for App Processing (15 minutes):**

          * **Goal:** Get the LLM to output data in a format that's easy for an application to "read" and process (e.g., for showing in a database or a structured UI).
          * **Prompt:**
            ```
            Extract the product name, price, and availability status from the following product listing. Present the output in a clean JSON-like format. If a piece of information is missing, state "N/A".

            Product Listing:
            "Limited Edition Galactic Mug - now available for $19.99! Get yours before they're gone. (Currently in stock online)"
            ```
          * **Observe:** Did it produce output resembling JSON (e.g., `{"product_name": "...", "price": "...", "availability": "..."}`) with correct values? This is crucial for integrating LLMs into software. *If it struggles with JSON, try "bulleted list format" as an easier alternative for now.*

    5.  **Task 4: User Expectation Setting (10 minutes):**

          * **Goal:** Design a prompt that an LLM could use to explain its limitations to a user within an application.
          * **Prompt:**
            ```
            You are an AI assistant designed to help users brainstorm creative ideas. Explain to a new user in 2 sentences that while you are great at generating ideas, you don't have personal experiences or feelings, and you can sometimes make factual errors.
            ```
          * **Observe:** Does it clearly and concisely state its nature and limitations in a user-friendly way? This is key for responsible AI deployment.

  * **Conclusion of Hands-on Session:**

      * You've actively explored challenges beyond just getting an answer: dealing with incorrect information, guiding users, and demanding structured output. You've begun to think about the robustness and user-friendliness of LLM-powered applications, crucial steps before you start building your own.

### **Homework for Hour 9**

  * **Exercise 1: The "What If?" Scenario:**
      * Pick one of the LLM application ideas you came up with in Hour 7.
      * Describe one specific way the LLM could provide a *bad* or unhelpful output for that application.
      * Then, propose a prompt or a follow-up action you could implement to either prevent that bad output or correct it.
  * **Exercise 2: User Clarification Prompt:**
      * Imagine a user types: "Help me write a story."
      * Design a prompt (what *your app* would send to the LLM) that asks the user 3-4 specific clarifying questions to get enough detail to write a good story (e.g., genre, characters, setting).
      * Submit your prompt and the LLM's clarifying questions.
  * **Exercise 3: Structured Data Challenge:**
      * Take a short paragraph from a Wikipedia page about any historical event (e.g., the moon landing, building of the pyramids).
      * Prompt the LLM to extract the *event name*, *primary date*, and *main participants* from the paragraph.
      * Require the output to be in a bulleted list format with clear labels for each piece of information.
      * Submit the original paragraph, your prompt, and the LLM's structured output.
