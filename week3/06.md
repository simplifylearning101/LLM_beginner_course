### **Week 3: Hour 6 - Advanced Agentic Concepts**

#### **30% Theory: The Future of Autonomous Agents** ðŸ¤–

In this final hour of Week 3, we'll look beyond the basics to explore more advanced agentic concepts. We'll discuss how to give an agent memory and a more sophisticated reasoning ability, which are key to building truly autonomous systems.

  * **Memory in Agents:** Our current chatbot's memory is simply a list of past messages. This works for short conversations, but what about long-term memory?

      * **Short-Term Memory:** The conversation history itself. It's limited by the LLM's context window.
      * **Long-Term Memory:** A more permanent store of key facts, conversation summaries, or user preferences. This is often implemented using a vector database (just like RAG) where old conversations are summarized, embedded, and stored. When a user returns, their old memories can be retrieved and added to the prompt.

  * **Planning & Self-Correction:** Our current agents react to one prompt at a time. More advanced agents can perform multi-step planning.

      * **Chain-of-Thought:** This is a prompting technique where you ask the LLM to "think step by step" before providing its final answer. The intermediate "thoughts" can be used by your code to correct the LLM's path or provide missing information.
      * **Tree-of-Thoughts:** A more complex version where the LLM explores multiple reasoning paths and prunes the ones that don't look promising.

  * **The Rise of Autonomous Agents:** These concepts are central to the goal of creating agents that can complete complex, long-running tasks with minimal human intervention. We're talking about agents that can:

      * Research a topic online.
      * Draft a report.
      * Create a presentation based on the report.
      * Send the presentation via email.
        Each of these steps requires planning, tool use, and memory.

  * **Future Challenges:** While powerful, agents face challenges like reliability, cost, and the risk of taking unintended actions ("runaway agents").

#### **70% Hands-on Session: Exploring Agentic Concepts (Conceptual)**

  * **Objective:** We will not write new code in this hour. Instead, you will analyze and understand the pseudo-code for a more advanced agent to grasp these concepts without the friction of a complex setup.

  * **Instructions:**

    1.  Read the following pseudo-code for a "Financial Analyst Agent."
    2.  Carefully read the comments to understand what each part of the agent is doing.
    3.  Imagine you are running this code and trace the logic for a query like, "What was the stock price for Apple at the end of 2023, and what was the company's revenue in the same period?"

  * **Pseudo-Code Example:**

    ```python
    # -- A more advanced agent architecture (conceptual pseudo-code) --

    # 1. Define Tools with Detailed Descriptions
    TOOLS = {
        "get_stock_price_history": {
            "description": "Retrieves historical stock prices for a ticker over a date range.",
            "parameters": {"ticker": str, "start_date": str, "end_date": str}
        },
        "search_financial_news": {
            "description": "Searches for financial news articles for a company.",
            "parameters": {"company_name": str, "date_range": str}
        },
        "summarize_document": {
            "description": "Summarizes a long document or article.",
            "parameters": {"document_text": str}
        }
    }

    # 2. Define a function to retrieve long-term memory
    def retrieve_long_term_memory(user_id):
        # In a real app, this would query a vector database
        # and get summaries of past conversations and preferences.
        return "Memory: User is interested in tech stocks and historical data."

    # 3. The Agentic Loop
    def run_financial_agent(user_query, user_id):
        # Step A: Augment the initial prompt with long-term memory
        user_history = retrieve_long_term_memory(user_id)
        system_prompt = f"You are a financial analyst. {user_history} Your tools are: {TOOLS}"
        
        # Step B: LLM Planning & Initial Action
        llm_response = get_llm_response(
            prompt=f"{system_prompt}\nUser Query: {user_query}\nPlan Step-by-Step:"
        )
        
        # Step C: The Agentic Loop
        while not is_final_answer(llm_response):
            # Parse LLM's planned action (e.g., "ACTION: CALL_TOOL...")
            action, params = parse_tool_call(llm_response)
            
            # Execute the tool
            tool_result = execute_tool(action, params)
            
            # Step D: LLM Self-Correction & Next Action
            llm_response = get_llm_response(
                prompt=f"{system_prompt}\nObservation: {tool_result}\nUser Query: {user_query}\nNext Action:"
            )
            
        return llm_response # Final answer
    ```

#### **Homework for Hour 6**

  * **Exercise 1: Designing an Autonomous Agent.**

      * **Goal:** Design a hypothetical autonomous agent from scratch.
      * **Topic:** Choose a domain (e.g., "Personal Travel Agent," "Social Media Content Generator," "Academic Researcher").
      * **Submission:** Write a short document (2-3 paragraphs) that outlines:
        1.  **Purpose:** What is the agent's ultimate goal?
        2.  **Tools:** What external tools or data sources would it need? (e.g., flight API, calendar, web search).
        3.  **Memory:** What information would it need to remember long-term about the user or its past tasks?
        4.  **Planning:** Describe a complex task and how the agent would break it down into a sequence of tool calls and internal thoughts.
        5.  **Challenges:** What are two potential failure modes or ethical concerns for your agent?

  * **Conclusion of Week 3:** You've made a giant leap in your LLM development journey. From building a simple RAG chatbot to conceptualizing truly autonomous agents, you now understand the cutting-edge of LLM applications. You're ready to start building your own projects.
