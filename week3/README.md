The theme for Week 3 is **Advanced Applications & Agentic Systems**. ðŸ¤–

### Week 3: An Introduction

This week, we'll elevate your skills from single-turn API calls to building intelligent, multi-step applications. We'll start by mastering the concept of **chaining LLM calls**, which allows you to break down complex problems into a series of smaller, manageable tasks.

The core focus, however, will be on **agentic systems**. You'll learn to move beyond simple question-answering and empower LLMs to reason, make decisions, and interact with external "tools" you provide. A key part of this will be **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, a powerful technique that connects LLMs to your private data or external knowledge bases, enabling them to provide accurate, up-to-date, and context-specific information while dramatically reducing hallucinations.

By the end of this week, you'll be able to build applications where the LLM isn't just a text generator, but a dynamic reasoning engine capable of automating complex workflows.
