## ü§ù Day 3: The Human Touch & Finalization

**Objective:** On the final day, we'll polish the user experience and add the final booking confirmation step. We'll make the bot more conversational and ensure it provides a clear, final summary of the reservation.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Enhance the system prompt:** Add more conversational and human-like instructions to the prompt to give the bot personality.
2.  **Add confirmation logic:** Once a booking is successful, we'll introduce a final message that confirms all details and provides a confirmation number.
3.  **Finalize the script:** Combine all the elements into a cohesive and easy-to-run final script.

If a time is unavailable, be sure to offer alternative times. Be concise and empathetic. Do not book a reservation unless all four pieces of information are provided. Do not make up dates, times, or party sizes. Once the table is booked, provide the user with the confirmation number: 'A-123-BOOKING' and a friendly closing remark. Never make up a confirmation number. If the user thanks you after booking, respond with a polite and friendly closing remark. Always ask for the full date in YYYY-MM-DD format."}

**What the code does:**

  * A new tool, `book_table`, is added. The LLM's system prompt now tells it to use this tool once all required information is gathered and availability is confirmed.
  * The `execute_tool_call` function is updated to handle calls to both `check_availability` and `book_table`.
  * The `main` loop is now more robust, capable of handling a full conversational flow from greeting to confirmation. The bot's personality is enhanced through the new system prompt, making the interaction more natural and satisfying.
